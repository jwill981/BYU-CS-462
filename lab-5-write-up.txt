1.  I have a global variable that is an array of strings that 
    has the necessary RIDs for a new child pico. I loop through
    that array and send an install ruleset request to the child 
    to install the ruleset.
2.  I raised the wrangler child initialized event to ensure the child
    was ready to raise events to it. 
3.  I used postman and called different urls to create and delete children.
    I then waited for a text due to a threshold violation to ensure the 
    children behaved as expected.
4.  When the child is initialized I can give it an array of other sensors.
    When a new sensor is added I can send an updated array to all children.
