1.  I used a rule conditional statement. The advantage of this is that 
    the conditional is evaluated in the select statement rather than farther
    down in the rule.
2.  An advantage for a channel for each sensor would be you would be able to 
    keep track of which sensor is sending data. You could also customize each 
    sensor as needed. Also, they are all independent from each other.
3.  The output was the genericThing object. Only one directive was returned since 
    that is the first rule that is called by the emitter. At least 2 rules ran. One in the emitter
    and one in the base ruleset.
4.  The output was the temperature in farenheight and a timestamp. 2 directive were returned. At least 
    3 rules ran. One in the emitter and 2 in the base ruleset.

6.  I would say yes because all the rule does if check a condition and then raise another event.
    This pattern is an abstract event expression because it takes what could be a complext rule
    and splits it into simple parts.
7.  I know it works because I log out the sensor temp:
    05:20:36.836Z [KLOG] temp from sensor:  60
    I also know because I log a message when the rule even is raised:
    05:29:56.185Z [KLOG] I called violation rule! {"temperature":80}
