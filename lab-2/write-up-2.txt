1.  The collect_temperatures rule and temperatures function work
    as an event-query API because the ruleset is installed on a 
    pico with the wovyn emiiter. When that ruleset raises an event, 
    the temperature_store ruleset will select a rule. 

2.  To find temperatures that are in range, I use the difference set operator because
    I store the data in 2 arrays. This finds the set of all members of allTemps that 
    are not members of thresholdViolations.

3.  If we didn't list the temperatures function in provides, then we wouldn't 
    be able to use that function in another ruleset.

4. If we didn't list the temperatures function in shares, then the functions would
    only be able to be called from its own ruleset.
