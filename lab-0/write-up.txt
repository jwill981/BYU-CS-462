6. When I delete the channel, I get an ECI not found error. This is because the ECI is used to determine which channel to use.
7. When I send the event echo/hello, I get an object of data that is specified in the ruleset for this function. 
8. When echo is mispelled, I get a not allowed by channel policy error. This is because the channel event policy only allows the use of echo and nothing else.
9. There was no difference in output when using the ternary conditional. The || operator is preferable because it leads to more readable code and is easier to understand because this is a simple use of a conditional.
